1. The output cluster needs to be wired dynamically. The data needs to be known anyway.
2. The datatype of the input to the next SubVI needs to be known.
3. The datatype given as an input to the "Variant to Data" needs to be given as a typedef so that for any change in the datatype, it needs to be changed only at the typedef.
4. During the use of the "String to Cluster / LabVIEW Datatype" use the have only one element for all the array to avoid the following:
a. Change of datastructure for a particular element of an array and leaving out the remaining
b. Speed of the creation of the main cluster
