1. Default :
-> Use the captured image for single FOV by default

-> Use the table canvas for Full scan by default

The following can be the solutions for the overlays dragged out of the FOV during configuration :

-> Increase the canvas by a pre-defined percentage on the condition that the overlays are moved out of the FOV.

-> Increase the canvas only by a calculated pixel quantity based on how the overlay has moved out of the FOV in terms of X and Y.

-> Bring the overlay just within the bounds of the FOV.

-> Draw the overlay at the previous drawn location.

The following can be the solution for the overlays drawn out of the FOV during inspection :

-> The part can be cut along its bounding box and placed within the center fo FOV of the canvas image for display.

-> Increase the canvas by a fixed preset percentage

-> Increase the canvas dynamically based upon the maximum (Left, Top, Right, Bottom) taken up by the overlays.

-> Bring the overlay just within the bounds of the FOV.

Takeaways :

Immediate (IFB) :
1. Fixed percentage addition on all sides of canvas during launch and maintain throughout execution (Border pixels).
2. Bring the overlays just within the image boundary during configuration and inspection.

Later (v3) :
1. Look into competitors implementation.
2. Overlapping of overlays.
3. Dynamic canvas adjustment.
